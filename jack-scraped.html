Roseland Cottage, Woodstock CT

With its distinctive pink exterior, Roseland Cottage was built in 1846 as the summer home of wealthy businessman Henry Bowen, his wife Lucy, and their young family in <a href="https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/woodstock/" target='_blank'>Woodstock, Connecticut</a>. The house is an excellent example of Gothic Revival architecture, which was popular in the mid-1800s and featured elements like steep-pitched roofs, use of pointed arches for doors, windows, and ornamental elements, and decorative cut or pierced wood trim, sometimes referred to as "gingerbread trim."<br><br>The five-bedroom, 6,000-square-foot house was designed by English-born architect Joseph C. Wells. The estate also includes landscaped grounds and gardens, an ice house, aviary, carriage barn, and the nation's oldest surviving indoor bowling alley.<br><br>In the 1870s the house and its outbuildings were expanded to accommodate the growing Bowen family and their needs. The larger service areas included a laundry room, butler's pantry, scullery, and additional bedrooms for live-in staff. In the 1880s the Bowens redecorated the home‚Äôs interior, replacing fireplace tiles, adding stained glass in the parlor windows, and installing new carpets and wall coverings in the latest styles.<br><br>Although Roseland Cottage was primarily a family retreat, Henry Bowen entertained friends and important guests--including four U.S. presidents--there. In 1870 President Ulysses S. Grant attended elaborate Fourth of July celebrations at Roseland Cottage.<br><br><a href='https://www.historicnewengland.org/property/roseland-cottage/' target='_blank'>More</a> about Roseland Cottage.



The Frog Bridge, Willimantic CT

This bridge across the Willimantic River might look like any other highway bridge, except for the four giant frogs sitting atop spools of thread at each end. Known officially as the Thread City Crossing, the bridge opened in 2000, replacing an 1857 stone bridge, which is now a pedestrian walkway. The bronze frog sculptures are the work of artist Leo Jensen of Ivoryton, Connecticut, and they commemorate one of the strangest tales from Connecticut's history -- "The Great Windham Frog Fight" or "Battle of the Frogs."<br><br>Life on the frontier in mid-18th-century Connecticut was dangerous, and the <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticut-in-the-french-and-indian-war/' target='_blank'>French and Indian War</a> had just broken out. And so it was that when the residents of the village of <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/windham/' target='_blank'>Windham</a> heard a dreadful cacophony one night in 1754, they were terrified. Some thought the village was under attack; others thought it was the trumpets of Judgment Day. Brave men ventured out and fired their muskets towards the noise.<br><br>As day broke there was quiet, and soon everything was explained. Hundreds of bullfrog corpses littered the ground near a small pond about a mile east of the village. It seems that a summer drought had caused the frogs to battle to the death over the limited water available.<br><br>In the years that followed, the story became very popular, inspiring various songs and works of art, including the current Frog Bridge. In 2002, the Federal Highway Administration awarded the Frog Bridge an honorable mention for Excellence in Highway Design in the category of Historic Preservation.<br><br><a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/bridge-ornaments-help-tell-the-legend-of-the-windham-frog-fight/' target='_blank'>More</a> about Great Windham Frog Fight


Armsmear, Hartford CT

Armsmear was the home of manufacturing pioneer <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/people/samuel-colt/' target='_blank'>Samuel Colt</a> and his family. Colt built the palatial estate on the western edge of his <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/' target='_blank'>Hartford</a> property following his marriage to <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/elizabeth-jarvis-colt-born-today-in-history/' target='_blank'>Elizabeth Jarvis</a> in 1856. The architect is unknown, but landscape architects Cleveland and Copeland designed the extensive grounds, which included ponds, fountains, a deer park, and greenhouses filled year-round with fruits and flowers.<br><br>The house was described in an 1876 publication as "an Italian villa in stone, massive, noble, refined, yet not carrying out any decided principle of architecture, it is like its originator, bold and unusual in its combinations. While one corner of the house was dominated by an Italianate tower, there were also Turkish-style domes and ornamentation.<br><br>Inside, the "picture-gallery," which also served as a ballroom, housed works of art and cases containing jewels and valuable gifts presented to Colt by foreign dignitaries, as well as the cradle made from wood of the famous <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticuts-the-legend-of-the-charter-oak/' target='_blank'>Charter Oak</a> for Samuel and Elizabeth's first-born son.<br><br>Samuel Colt <a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/sam-colts-funeral-the-day-hartford-stopped-2/' target='_blank'>died in 1862</a> and was buried on the Armsmear grounds. Elizabeth later moved Samuel's remains and those of four of their children (also buried on the grounds) to Cedar Hill Cemetery. In accordance with Elizabeth's will, the house became a home for widows and dependents of Episcopal clergymen after her death in 1905. Elizabeth bequeathed the grounds and gardens of the estate to the City of Hartford to form the 140-acre Colt Park. Armsmear was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1976.<br><br><a href='https://connecticuthistory.org/samuel-colt-from-yankee-peddler-to-american-tycoon/' target='_blank'>More</a> about Samuel Colt<br><br>Visit <a href='https://www.nps.gov/colt/index.htm' target='_blank'>Coltsville National Historic Park</a>
